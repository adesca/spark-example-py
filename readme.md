## Welcome!

To use this repository you need to: 
1) Run `pip install pyspark`
2) Run src\main\crimes.py
3) ???
4) Get staffed!

Our preferred IDE for this workshop is pycharm which can be downloaded [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)

To setup a run configuration/run a file right click a python file and click run. 

If you have a java problem, set the JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_201.
You can also set this as an environment variable in the run configuration.

 If you don't want to permanently set your system JAVA_HOME (I use Java 11 for my current client and need to easily switch between Java 11 and Java 8), you can set the Java PyCharm will use.
 
 
 Go to PyCharm, Help->Find Action... then enter switch and select "Switch Java SDK" or something similar.
Then you can set your PyCharm to use Java 8 and not change your system settings
You might have to select something in the event log to confirm the switch.
